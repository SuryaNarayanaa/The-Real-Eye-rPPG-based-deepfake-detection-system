Steps for Deepfake Detection using rPPG:
Video Preprocessing:

Load the video file.
Extract individual frames for processing.
Face Detection:

Detect and crop the face region in each frame using a face detection algorithm (e.g., Haar Cascade, MTCNN).
Skin Region Extraction (Optional):

Focus on skin regions such as the forehead and cheeks, which are more indicative of rPPG signals.
Extract RGB Channels:

For each face region in every frame, extract the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color channels.
rPPG Signal Extraction:

Calculate spatial averages of the Green channel values (most correlated with blood flow) over time.
Extract temporal changes in the Green channel using frame differencing to capture color variations over time.
Signal Preprocessing:

Normalize the rPPG signals by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation to remove lighting conditions.
Apply a bandpass filter (0.7–4.0 Hz) to isolate heart rate frequencies.
rPPG Signal Enhancement:

Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate physiological signals from noise and improve the clarity of the rPPG signal.
Heart Rate Estimation:

Use Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to find the dominant frequency in the rPPG signal and estimate the heart rate.
Inconsistency Detection:

Analyze the periodicity and consistency of the heart rate signal. Deepfakes often fail to maintain realistic physiological signals over time, resulting in irregularities.
Classifier (Optional):

Train a machine learning classifier (e.g., SVM, CNN) to distinguish between real and deepfake videos based on the extracted rPPG signal patterns and their inconsistencies.
Deepfake Prediction:
Use the trained model or direct comparison of rPPG signals to predict whether the video is real or a deepfake.
